            <h5>What is the internet?</h5>
            <p>The internet is a vast network of interconnected computers that use the Internet protocol suite
                (TCP/ICP) to communicate between networks and devices. The internet is a result of an experiment that
                is known as the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network more commonly referred to as the
                Arpanet. Paul Baran, a computer network pioneer had an idea to build a communication system that
                would survive a nuclear attack. He did this by creating breaking messages up into blocks and sending
                them out nationwide resulting in the creation of the packet network.</p>
            <h5>Who oversees the internet?</h5>
            <p>Nobody and everybody! The internet is a global distributed network that is comprised of many
                interconnected independently operated networks that operates without a central governing body. Like
                the telephone network no company or government can take claim to the whole thing. However, many
                individuals’ companies and governments own certain fragments of it.
                What does the internet work?</p>
            <p>The internet has a simple job: to move computerized information also known as date from one place to
                another. Like the postal service the internet works in the same manner. Letters in the postal service
                are
                passed from one place to another no matter who and where they are from and what they contain. Like
                the mail service, the internets simplicity means that it can handle many kinds of information resulting
                in
                helping people to do many different jobs. Because the internet is not specialized to passing along only
                emails: all information is handled equally and passed on in the same way.</p>
            <h5>How does Internet data move?</h5>
            <p>Most data over the internet moves by packet switching. Packet switching is the transfer of small pieces
                of data across various networks. These data chunks or “packets” enables a faster and more efficient
                data transfer. When a user sends a file across a network, it is transferred into smaller data packets,
                not
                in one piece.</p>
            <p>For example, what if you decided to dismantle your house brick by brick, number each brick put them in
                a box and mail them separately to Canada? All the bricks that you mailed can travel by separate routes.
                For example, brick number 1 can travel by ship, brick number 2 can travel by air. Some might travel
                quicker than others, but none of that matters if it arrives at its designated destination. Once all the
                bricks arrive you can put them back together to recreate your house. By mailing your bricks, this would
                not affect any other person’s mail because the bricks would be traveling parallel over many separate
                routes at the same times, they would probably arrive much quicker. Similarly, packet switching works in
                the same manner. When you send an email, the data is split up into various packets that travel
                separately over the internet.</p>
