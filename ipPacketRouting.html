            <h1>IP Addresses, Packets and Routing</h1>

            <h5>IP Address</h5>
            <p>IP stands for “internet protocol” which is a set of rules that dictate how data should be delivered over
                the public network (internet). An IP address is the identifier that allows information to be sent
                between
                devices on a network: they contain local information which allow devices to be accessible for
                communication. The internet needs a way to differentiate between different computers, routers,
                websites, and an IP address proves a way of doing so. Like your home address an IP Address is a unique
                address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network. An IP address is a string of
                numbers
                separated by periods. IP addresses are expressed as a set of four numbers. For example, 154.234.5.65.
                Each number in the sent can range from 0 to 255.</p>

            <p>IP addresses are not random numbers, but instead are a mathematically produced and allocated by the
                internet assigned numbers authority. Any time someone registers a domain on the internet, they go
                through a domain name registrar who then pays a fee to the Corporation for Assigned Names and
                Numbers to register the domain.</p>

            </div>

            <h5>How do IP addresses work?</h5>
            <p>Internet protocol works in the same manner as a language, by communicating using set guidelines to
                pass along information. By using this protocol devices find, send, and exchange information with other
                connected devices. By “speaking the same language” any device in any location can talk to one another.
                Packets</p>
            <p>In most networks’ packets are the unit of communication and transmission. The rules of TCP/IP require
                information to be split into packets that contain both a segment of data to be transferred and the
                address where the data needs to be sent. Each IP packet contains both a header which is about 20 to 24
                bytes long and data (variable length). The header includes the IP address of the source and destination,
                plus other information that helps rout the packet. The data is the actual content, for example a string
                of
                letters that is a part of an email.</p>
            <h5>Routing</h5>
            <p>IP routing is the process of sending packets within and across IP networks. IP routing is a set of
                protocols
                that determine the path that data follows to travel across multiple networks from its source to its
                destination. Data is routed from its source to its destination through a series of routers, and across
                multiple networks.</p>
